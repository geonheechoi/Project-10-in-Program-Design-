# Project-10-in-Program-Design-
Project 10, Program Design 1. (60 points) Modify Project 9 so that the program is split into three source files and two header files. 1) Put all functions related to operations on the list of t-shirt into tshirt.c 2) Create a header file named tshirt.h that contains struct tshirt declaration and prototypes for the functions in tshirt.c. The header file should enclose the contents of the header file in an #ifndef-#endif pair to protect the file. 3) Put the read_line function in a separate file named readline.c. 4) Create a header file named readline.h that contains a prototype for the read_line function. The header file should enclose the contents of the header file in an #ifndef-#endif pair to protect the file. 5) tshirt_store2.c contains the main function. 6) Include appropriate header files in the source files. 2. (40 points) Write a makefile to build the program on student cluster. The makefile should contain the following rules: 1) Build readline.o by compiling readline.c 2) Build tshirt.o by compiling tshirt.c 3) Build tshirt_store2.o by compiling tshirt_store2.c 4) Build tshirt_store2 by linking readline.o, tshirt.o, and tshirt_store2.o Each rule should include the name of the target file, dependencies among files, and the command to be executed. The makefile should name the executable file for the program tshirt_store2.
